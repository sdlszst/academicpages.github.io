collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-12-16-Mechanical properties of high-entropy alloys with emphasis on face-centered cubic alloys
excerpt: 'High-entropy alloys (HEAs), also known as multi-principal element alloys or multi-component alloys, have been the subject of numerous investigations since they were first described in 2004.We review the principal mechanical properties of these alloys with emphasis on the face-centered cubic systems, such as the CrCoNi-based alloys. Their favorable mechanical properties and ease of processing by conventional means suggest extensive utilization in many future structural applications.'
