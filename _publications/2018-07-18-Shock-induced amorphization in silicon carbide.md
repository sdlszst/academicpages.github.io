excerpt: 'While SiC has been predicted to undergo pressure induced amorphization, the microstructural evidence of such a drastic phase change is absent as its brittleness usually prevents its successful recovery from high-pressure experiments. Here we report on the observatio of amorphous SiC recovered from laser-ablation-driven shock compression with a peak stress of about 50GPa. TEM reveals that the amorphous regions are extremely localized , forming bands as narrow as a few nanometers. In addition to these amorphous bands, planar stacking faults are observed. Large-scale non equilibrium MD simulations elucidate the process and suggest that the planar stacking faults serve as the precursors to amorphization. Our results suggest that the amorphous phase produced is a high density form, which enhances its thermodynamical stability under the high pressures combined with the shear stresses generated by the uniaxial strain state in shock compression'
