2020-05-20	Short-range order and its impact on the CrCoNi medium-entropy alloy	Nature	Traditional metallic alloys are mixtures of elements in which the atoms of minoriety species tend to be distributed randomly if they are below their solubility limit, or to form secondary phases if they are above it. The concept of multiple-principal-element alloys has recently expanded this view, as these materials are single-phase solid solutions of generally equiatomic mixtures of metallic elements. This group of materilas has received much interest owing to their enhanced mechanical properties. They are usually called MEA in ternary systems and HEA in quaternary or quinary systems, alluding to theri high degree of configurational entropy. However, the question has remined as to how random these solild solutions actually are, with the influence of short-range order being suggested in computational simulations but not seen experimentally. Here we report the observation, using energy-filtered TEM of structure features attibuted to short range order in the CrCoNi MEA. Increasing amounts of such order give rise to both higher stacking fault energy and hardness. These findings suggest that the degree of local ordering at the nanmetre scale can be tailored through thermomechanical processing, providing a new avenue for tuning the mechanical properties of MEAs and HEAs	"Ruopeng Zhang, Shiteng Zhao (contributed equally),Jun Ding, Yan Chong, Tao Jia, Colin Ophus, Mark Asta, Robert Ritchie, Andrew Minor.

2019-12-13	Direct imaging of short-range order and its impact on deformation in Ti-6Al	Science Advances	Chemical short range order(SRO) within a nominally single phase solid solution is known to affect the mechanical properties of alloys. While SRO has been indirectly related to deformation, direct observation of the SRO domain structure, and its effects on deformation mechanisms at the nanoscale, has remained elusive. Here, we report the direct observation of SRO in relatiuon to deformation using energy filtered imagin in a TEM. The diffraction contrast is enhanced by reducing the inelastically scattered electrons, revealing sub-nanometer SRO enhanced domains. The destruction of these domains by dislocation planar slip is observed after ex situ and in situ TEM mechanical testing. These results confirm the impact of SRO in Ti-Al alloys on the scale of angstroms. The direct confirmation of SRO in relationship to dislocatio plasticity in metals can provide insight into how the mechanical behavior of concentrated solid solutions by the material's thermal history.
