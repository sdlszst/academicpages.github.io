2020-05-20	Short-range order and its impact on the CrCoNi medium-entropy alloy	Nature	Traditional metallic alloys are mixtures of elements in which the atoms of minoriety species tend to be distributed randomly if they are below their solubility limit, or to form secondary phases if they are above it. The concept of multiple-principal-element alloys has recently expanded this view, as these materials are single-phase solid solutions of generally equiatomic mixtures of metallic elements. This group of materilas has received much interest owing to their enhanced mechanical properties. They are usually called MEA in ternary systems and HEA in quaternary or quinary systems, alluding to theri high degree of configurational entropy. However, the question has remined as to how random these solild solutions actually are, with the influence of short-range order being suggested in computational simulations but not seen experimentally. Here we report the observation, using energy-filtered TEM of structure features attibuted to short range order in the CrCoNi MEA. Increasing amounts of such order give rise to both higher stacking fault energy and hardness. These findings suggest that the degree of local ordering at the nanmetre scale can be tailored through thermomechanical processing, providing a new avenue for tuning the mechanical properties of MEAs and HEAs	"Ruopeng Zhang, Shiteng Zhao (contributed equally),Jun Ding, Yan Chong, Tao Jia, Colin Ophus, Mark Asta, Robert Ritchie, Andrew Minor.

2019-12-13	Direct imaging of short-range order and its impact on deformation in Ti-6Al	Science Advances	Chemical short range order(SRO) within a nominally single phase solid solution is known to affect the mechanical properties of alloys. While SRO has been indirectly related to deformation, direct observation of the SRO domain structure, and its effects on deformation mechanisms at the nanoscale, has remained elusive. Here, we report the direct observation of SRO in relatiuon to deformation using energy filtered imagin in a TEM. The diffraction contrast is enhanced by reducing the inelastically scattered electrons, revealing sub-nanometer SRO enhanced domains. The destruction of these domains by dislocation planar slip is observed after ex situ and in situ TEM mechanical testing. These results confirm the impact of SRO in Ti-Al alloys on the scale of angstroms. The direct confirmation of SRO in relationship to dislocatio plasticity in metals can provide insight into how the mechanical behavior of concentrated solid solutions by the material's thermal history.

2018-12-16	Mechanical properties of high-entropy alloys with emphasis on face-centered cubic alloys	Progress in Materials Science	High-entropy alloys (HEAs), also known as multi-principal element alloys or multi-component alloys, have been the subject of numerous investigations since they were first described in 2004.We review the principal mechanical properties of these alloys with emphasis on the face-centered cubic systems, such as the CrCoNi-based alloys. Their favorable mechanical properties and ease of processing by conventional means suggest extensive utilization in many future structural applications.

2017-09-12	Generating gradient germanium nanostructures by shock-induced amorphization and crystallization	PNAS	Gradient nanostructures are attracting considerable interest due to their potential to obtain superior structural and functional properties of materials. Applying powerful laser-driven shocks (stresses of up to one-third million atmospheres, or 33 gigapascals) to germanium, we report here a complex gradient nanostructure consisting of, near the surface, nanocrystals with high density of nanotwins. Beyond there, the structure exhibits arrays of amorphous bands which are preceded by planar defects such as stacking faults generated by partial dislocations. At a lower shock stress, the surface region of the recovered target is completely amorphous. We propose that germanium undergoes amorphization above a threshold stress and that the deformation-generated heat leads to nanocrystallization. These experiments are corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations which show that supersonic partial dislocation bursts play a role in triggering the crystalline-to-amorphous transition.

2016-10-25	Directional amorphization of boron carbide subjected to laser shock compression	PNAS	Solid-state shock-wave propagation is strongly nonequilibrium in nature and hence rate dependent. Using high-power pulsed-laserdriven shock compression, unprecedented high strain rates can be achieved; here we report the directional amorphization in boron carbide polycrystals. At a shock pressure of 45âˆ¼50 GPa, multiple planar faults, slightly deviated from maximum shear direction, occur a few hundred nanometers below the shock surface. High- esolution transmission electron microscopy reveals that these planar faults are precursors of directional amorphization. It is proposed that the shear stresses cause the amorphization and that pressure assists the process by ensuring the integrity of the specimen. Thermal energy conversion calculations including heat transfer suggest that amorphization is a solid-state process. Such a phenomenon has significant effect on the ballistic performance of B4C.
