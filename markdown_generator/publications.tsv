2014-10-01	Influence of Severe Plastic Deformation on the Dynamic Strain Aging of Ultrafine Grained Al-Mg alloys	Acta Materiala	This paper concerns with the influence of grain refinement on the dynamic strain aging of the Al-Mg alloys. Multi-axial confined channel die compression method was used to fabricate Al-xMg (x ranges from 0.5 to 5 weight percentage) alloys with different grain sizes between 100 nm and 1 micrometer. Room temperature compression tests were conducted to investigate the flow stress serration, which is due to the dynamic pinning and unpinning of dislocation from Mg solutes. We observed an enhanced DSA effect caused by severe plastic deformation. A modified model was proposed to take into account many variables.
