2014-05-05	Influence of Severe Plastic Deformation on the Dynamic Strain Aging of Ultrafine Grained Al-Mg alloys	Acta Materiala	"This paper concerns with the influence of grain refinement on the dynamic strain aging of the Al-Mg alloys. Multi-axial confined channel die compression method was used to fabricate Al-xMg (x ranges from 0.5 to 5 weight percentage) alloys with different grain sizes between 100 nm and 1 micrometer. Room temperature compression tests were conducted to investigate the flow stress serration, which is due to the dynamic pinning and unpinning of dislocation from Mg solutes. We observed an enhanced DSA effect caused by severe plastic deformation. A modified model was proposed to take into account many variables.

2020-10-05	Defect reconfigration in a Ti–Al alloy via electroplasticity	Nature Materials	"It has been known for decades that the application of pulsed direct current can significantly enhance the formability of metals. However, the detailed mechanisms of this effect have been difficult to separate from simple Joule heating. Here, we study the electroplastic deformation of Ti–Al (7 at.% Al), an alloy that is uniquely suited for uncoupling this behaviour because, contrary to most metals, it has inherently lower ductility at higher temperature. We find that during mechanical deformation, electropulsing enhances cross-slip, producing a wavy dislocation morphology, and enhances twinning, which is similar to what occurs during cryogenic deformation. As a consequence, dislocations are prevented from localizing into planar slip bands that would lead to the early failure of the alloy under tension. Our results demonstrate that this macroscopic electroplastic behaviour originates from defect-level microstructural reconfiguration that cannot be rationalized by simple Joule heating."
