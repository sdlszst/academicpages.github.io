Improving the sustainability of structural materials is a constant thrust for advancing human civilization. Mechanical metallurgy, a discipline concerning how materials with distinctive microstructure response to mechanical stimuli, is, therefore, always rooted in the core of the physical metallurgy. My research, in general, falls into this broad category. Primarily, I am interested in the deformation and failure mechanisms of materials at extreme conditions and develops advanced ex-situ and in-situ characterization techniques to probe the physics of the deformation. Subsequently, these gathered information is used to guide metallurgical processing of the new alloys.
